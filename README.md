# GitHub Profile Viewer :octopus: :cat:
![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/RedSparr0w/node-csgo-parser.svg)

This is a small single page application using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) which displays an organization or users [GitHub](https://github.com/) profile information from the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/). The application styling uses [Google's Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/).

The application will hold on to two pieces of Redux state, the profile information and the current response from the API request. If a user isn't found, or if there's a network issue with the request the application will inform you of such.

## Installation Steps ðŸ’½
This application can be installed by running `yarn install`. Once installed you're able to launch the application in a local server by running `yarn start`. Once initialized the application can be accessed on localhost port `8000`.

There are a number of unit tests available which can be run with `yarn test`.
