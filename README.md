# React / Redux GitHub Profile
This is a small single page application using React and Redux which displays a users GitHub profile information from the GitHub API. The page styling uses Google's Material Design Lite.

The application will hold on to two pieces of state, the profile information and the current response from the API request. If a user isn't found, or if there's a network issue the application will inform you of such.

## Installation
This application can be installed via NPM by running `npm install`. Once installed you're able to start launch the application in a local server by running `npm start`.

## Tests
There are a number of unit tests available which can be initalized via `npm run test`.
